USAGE = """\
Metaswitch Clearwater bulk-provisioning autocompletion tool

This script must be run on a Homestead node.

This script takes a CSV file containing incomplete user information and
autocompletes it with sensible defaults.

Usage: bulk_create.py <csv file>

Each row in the input CSV file describes a user, and must contain 1-4
columns:
- public SIP ID (required)
- private SIP ID (optional, defaults to public SIP ID, stripping any sip:)
- realm (optional, defaults to system default)
- password (optional, defaults to auto-generated random password)

The script generates an output CSV file containing all 4 columns for each
user.  You can then pass this CSV file to bulk_create.py to generate scripts
to bulk-provision these users.
